# Gesture Based UI Project

## Main Objective
Develop an application with a Natural User Interface. This should be a local implementation of the application using gestures to interact
with it. For example, a voice controlled application fits the parameters of gesture based control. You
can expand out to include real-world hardware and use this as an opportunity to prove a concept. You can reproduce a classic game or system using a gesture-based interface. For example, a
platformer game or a navigation application using Kinect or voice control. Maybe Tetris using the
Myo armbands to control the blocks, or Flappy Bird using the Kinect as the controller. Applications
with multiple users are also acceptable.

## My Idea
My original idea for this project was to create a game very similar to "Super Mario Bro's". However instead of using the classic arrow keys to move the player, I planned on using just
voice commands. Unfortunately, I had to scrap this idea as I could not come up with a solution for allowing the player to move left or right while jumping which is a classic feature in
the original "Super Mario Bro's" game.
 
I then came up with the idea of creating a basic 2D platformer, which involves the user navigating the character through different obstacles using only voice commands.
The main objective of the game is to get the character to the chest which is at the bottom of each level. As the user progresses through the levels, the difficulty of them increase.
For example in some of the later levels, platforms will begin to move and traps are also added which restart the level if the user comes into contact with them.


## Purpose of Application
The main purpose of this application is to implement voice commands into a 2D platformer game where the user only uses voice commands to move the character.
The main objectives I have for this project are:

- Allow the user control the character by using voice commands.
- Have a start menu which uses voice commands to navigate it.
- Allow the user to pause the game by simply saying "Pause".
- Allow the user to access a help menu to view the controls of the game and find of the main objective of the game.
