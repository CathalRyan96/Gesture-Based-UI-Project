# Gesture Based UI Project

## Main Objective
Develop an application with a Natural User Interface. This should be a local implementation of the application using gestures to interact
with it. For example, a voice controlled application fits the parameters of gesture based control. You
can expand out to include real-world hardware and use this as an opportunity to prove a concept. You can reproduce a classic game or system using a gesture-based interface. For example, a
platformer game or a navigation application using Kinect or voice control. Maybe Tetris using the
Myo armbands to control the blocks, or Flappy Bird using the Kinect as the controller. Applications
with multiple users are also acceptable
